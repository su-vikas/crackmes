## Installation

Currently the application is unsigned and you need to sign it before installing on an iDevice. If you have developer profile, you can sign the app using [iOS App Signer](https://dantheman827.github.io/ios-app-signer/) or run it on a jailbroken device. You will need to do one of them anyways.  


Open an issue if you face any problem in running the application.
