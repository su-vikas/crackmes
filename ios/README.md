##Objective

The goal is to find a secret string to unlock the application. On successfully guessing the secret string you will be greeted with "You are a SmartAss!!" message. 
There are multiple defense mechanisms inbuilt into the application to challenge your reversing skills. 

##Installation

Currently the application is unsigned and you need to sign it before installing on an iDevice. If you have developer profile, you can sign the app using [iOS App Signer](https://dantheman827.github.io/ios-app-signer/).
